    <h1>Life in Sweden</h1>
    <p>Few people drink more coffee than the Swedes. In Sweden, coffee drinking is fostered through a tradition called 'fika' â€“ in which friends, family or colleagues meet for coffee or tea, often with something sweet on the side. Most Swedes will enjoy at least one fika a day as an opportunity to bond.

        Check out the recipe for chocolate balls, one of the Swedes' fika favourites, below.</p>
